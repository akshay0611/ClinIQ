## 👨‍💼 Project Leadership

As **Project Admin** during **Hacktoberfest 2025**, I spearheaded both the technical development and community growth of ClinIQ. Here's what that looked like:

### 🏗️ Technical Contributions
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Designed and built the entire system using React, TypeScript, Supabase, and Gemini AI—from database schema to UI components
- **Core Features:** Developed the AI symptom checker, doctor discovery system, appointment booking flow, and role-based dashboards for patients and doctors
- **Database Engineering:** Architected PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and data integrity constraints
- **UI/UX Development:** Created responsive, accessible interfaces with Tailwind CSS and smooth animations using Framer Motion

### 🤝 Community & Project Management
- **Open Source Leadership:** Managed issues and pull requests during Hacktoberfest, maintaining code quality while welcoming diverse contributions from the community
- **Contributor Support:** Mentored developers (including first-time contributors) through code reviews, issue discussions, and technical guidance
- **Documentation:** Wrote clear setup guides, contributing guidelines, and inline code documentation to lower the barrier for new contributors
- **Deployment & DevOps:** Set up CI/CD pipeline and production deployment, ensuring the platform is accessible to real users

### 🎯 Impact
This project taught me how to balance technical excellence with community building—writing clean, maintainable code while fostering an inclusive environment for contributors of all skill levels. The result is a production-ready healthcare platform that's both technically sound and community-driven.
